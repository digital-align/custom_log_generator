# In this file, you need to declare the logs you want
# Please refer to examples below
#
# Let's assume you want two custom logs, "ORDER_LOGGER", "ERROR_LOGGER"
# and they log path for them should be "log/order.log" and "log/error.log"
#
# then, you should declare them like:
#
# - 'log/error.log'
# - 'log/order.log'
